  <h1>Code</h1>  
  <p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication">communications</a> and information processing, <strong>code</strong> is a system of rules to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example is an invention of language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard, or felt to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered. The invention of writing, which converted spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication across space and time.</p>
  <h2>Theory</h2>
  <hr>
  <p style="margin-left:5%">Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_theory">Coding theory</a></p>
  <p>There are four types of coding:<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_theory#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
  <ol>
    <li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression>Data compression</a> (or source coding)</li>
    <li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction>Error control</a> (or channel coding)</li>
    <li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography>Cryptographic coding</a></li>
    <li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_code>Line coding</a></li>
</ol>
  <p>Data compression attempts to remove unwanted redundancy from the data from a source in order to transmit it more efficiently. For example, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE>DEFLATE</a> data compression makes files smaller, for purposes such as to reduce Internet traffic. Data compression and error correction may be <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_source_and_channel_coding>studied in combination</a>.</p>
<h3>Other examples</h3>
<hr>
<p>Other examples of encoding include:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Encoding (in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition>cognition</a>) - a basic perceptual process of interpreting incoming stimuli; technically speaking, it is a complex, multi-stage process of converting relatively objective sensory input (e.g., light, sound) into a subjectively meaningful experience.</li>
    <li>A <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_format>content format</a> - a specific encoding format for converting a specific type of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data>data</a> to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information>information</a>.</li>
    <li>Text encoding uses a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language>markup language to tag the structure and other features of a text to facilitate processing by computers. (See also <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative>Text Encoding Initiative</a>.)</a></li>
